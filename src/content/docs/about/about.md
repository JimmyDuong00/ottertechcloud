Hi! I'm J.

I am a system admin that loves to learn about all things computers. 

From low level systems such as Control Systems, up to applications hosted on Cloud servers such as Azure, I try my best to understand how technology allows us to connect with each other and the science that allows us to do so. 

Feel free to check out my Github and connect with me on LinkedIn!
